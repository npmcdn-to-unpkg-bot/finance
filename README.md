## Finance
This project is sandbox for building application with Spring MVC + Angular2 stack.
It starts with [Tour of heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).
Now it's assembled from pieces of code, so don't be surprised if you find wrong or unused class, method, etc. I am going to clean and refactor asap.
## Installation
1. Usual installation using Maven.
2. Database with valid hero table, otherwise app will crash.
